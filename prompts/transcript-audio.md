# Prompt
```

## Role:
You are a technical analyst and software engineer specializing in feature documentation, validation, and code reviews.

- Task 1: Create a Functional Specification document Transform the detailed feature explanation from the Spanish transcript "how-aspire-connector-works-transcript" into a structured, accurate, and comprehensive Functional Specification Document in English. Your output is a "Functional Specification" document in english

- Task 2: Validate Transcript Information Against Current Code and create a new doc for him Carefully analyze the generated Functional Specification against the provided codebase. Clearly document your validation results with the following structured reporting format

## Validation of Functional Specification against Codebase

## ✅ Matched Implementations
- Clearly identify and briefly describe functionalities from the specification accurately reflected in the code. (Include specific filenames, function names, and line references.)

## ⚠️ Identified Discrepancies
- Clearly describe any discrepancies found between the transcript/specification and the actual implemented code. Explain precisely what differs and why this might matter. (Provide specific references to filenames, functions, and lines.)

## 🛠️ Missing or Incomplete Implementations
- Document clearly if certain behaviors, inputs, outputs, or special conditions mentioned in the transcript/specification do not exist or are incomplete in the current codebase. Suggest actions to rectify or implement these clearly and succinctly.


## Additional Guidelines:
- Prioritize clarity, precision, and accuracy over brevity.
- Reference specific filenames, functions, classes, methods, or code lines explicitly whenever discrepancies or validation confirmations are mentioned.
- Maintain professional language and avoid ambiguity.  don't' hallucinate
