## Notes
I need to adjust it to avoid conflic with the global rules

# Prompts



## 1. "What are the physics of this problem?"
- Musk strips everything to objective reality.
```
	What are the fundamental constraints, forces, and bottlenecks in this problem?
```

## 2. "If I couldn’t rely on existing assumptions, how would I solve this?"
- Assumptions are invisible cages.
```
Analyze this problem in two steps:

- List assumptions: Identify the key assumptions currently being made about how this problem should be solved (including my implicit assumptions if you can infer them).
- Break them: For each assumption, explore how we could solve the problem if that assumption did not hold or were relaxed.

Highlight any solutions that look especially promising in the real world.
```

## 3. "What are the problem’s fundamental components?"
- Musk breaks problems into atoms.
```
Break this problem down into its fundamental parts:

- the core goal
- key inputs
- key outputs
- main steps or processes
- important stakeholders/actors
- hard constraints.

Describe each briefly before suggesting any solutions.
```


## 4. "What would the optimal solution look like if cost didn’t exist?"
- Constraints ruin creativity too early.
```
Describe the ideal solution to this problem if budget were not a constraint.

- Assume we can afford best-in-class tools and enough people.
- Keep real-world constraints like physics, laws, and basic feasibility.

Then summarize the key characteristics that make this solution ‘ideal’.
```
- Brutal prioritization.
## 5. "If I were forced to cut 90 percent of this, what would remain?"
```
If I were forced to cut 90 percent of this, what would remain — meaning:

- Identify all main components (features, steps, ideas).
- Keep only the few that are truly essential to achieve the core goal.
- Explain why those remain and everything else can be cut or deferred.

Don’t just make the explanation shorter; explicitly show what’s kept vs removed.
```


## 6. "If this failed completely, what would be the root cause?"
- Musk starts with failure to engineer success.
```
If this failed completely, what would be the root cause?
```

## 7. "What would a solution look like if I ignored industry norms?"
- Musk bypasses entire industries by refusing to copy them.
```
First, identify the current industry norms for solving this type of problem. Then, propose an alternative solution that deliberately ignores those norms, while still respecting laws, safety, and basic feasibility.
Explain how your alternative differs and what advantages or risks it creates.
```



## 8. "What part of this is actually impossible and what part just feels impossible?"
- Most limits are emotional.
```
What part of this is actually impossible and what part just feels impossible?
```


## 9. "What is the minimum viable breakthrough?"
- Not minimum viable product. Minimum viable breakthrough.
```
Define the minimum viable breakthrough for this situation:

- Start by describing the current baseline (how things work today).
- Define what would count as a real breakthrough — a step change in value, performance, or experience, not just a small improvement.
- Propose the smallest concrete change or solution that would still qualify as that breakthrough.
- Explain why it’s a breakthrough and not just an incremental tweak.”
```

## 10. "If I restarted this entire project today, knowing what I know now, what would I build?"
- Clean slate thinking.
```
If I restarted this entire project today, knowing what I know now, what would I build?
```

## 11. "What are the hidden constraints I'm not questioning?"
- Most problems hide fake walls.
```
Given this situation, identify hidden or implicit constraints I might be assuming without noticing.

- First, list the explicit constraints I’ve stated.
- Then infer implicit constraints (things I seem to be assuming about tools, scope, roles, timelines, risks, or ‘how this must be done’).
- For each implicit constraint, say whether it is likely truly necessary or could be questioned or relaxed, and what would change if we did.
```

## 12. "How would I solve this if I only cared about physics, not politics?"
- Musk removes social friction from problem solving.
```
	How would I solve this if I only cared about physics, not politics?
```


## 13. "If I had to achieve this 10 times faster, what would I do?"
- Extreme deadlines force extreme creativity.
```
	If I had to achieve this 10 times faster, what would I do?
```

## 14. "What would this look like if it had to scale to millions?"
- Musk thinks in orders of magnitude.
```
What would this look like if it had to scale to millions?
```

## 15. "Which part of this solution creates the most leverage?"
- Musk always builds the part that changes everything.
```
Which part of this solution creates the most leverage?
```
