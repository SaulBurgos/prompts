## Notes
I need to adjust it to avoid conflic with the global rules

```
	What are the fundamental constraints, forces, and bottlenecks in this problem?
```

```
Analyze this problem in two steps:

- List assumptions: Identify the key assumptions currently being made about how this problem should be solved (including my implicit assumptions if you can infer them).
- Break them: For each assumption, explore how we could solve the problem if that assumption did not hold or were relaxed.

Highlight any solutions that look especially promising in the real world.
```

```
Break this problem down into its fundamental parts:

- the core goal
- key inputs
- key outputs
- main steps or processes
- important stakeholders/actors
- hard constraints.

Describe each briefly before suggesting any solutions.
```


```
Describe the ideal solution to this problem if budget were not a constraint.

- Assume we can afford best-in-class tools and enough people.
- Keep real-world constraints like physics, laws, and basic feasibility.

Then summarize the key characteristics that make this solution ‘ideal’.
```


```
If I were forced to cut 90 percent of this, what would remain — meaning:

- Identify all main components (features, steps, ideas).
- Keep only the few that are truly essential to achieve the core goal.
- Explain why those remain and everything else can be cut or deferred.

Don’t just make the explanation shorter; explicitly show what’s kept vs removed.
```


```
If this failed completely, what would be the root cause?
```

```
First, identify the current industry norms for solving this type of problem. Then, propose an alternative solution that deliberately ignores those norms, while still respecting laws, safety, and basic feasibility.
Explain how your alternative differs and what advantages or risks it creates.
```

```
What part of this is actually impossible and what part just feels impossible?
```

```
Define the minimum viable breakthrough for this situation:

- Start by describing the current baseline (how things work today).
- Define what would count as a real breakthrough — a step change in value, performance, or experience, not just a small improvement.
- Propose the smallest concrete change or solution that would still qualify as that breakthrough.
- Explain why it’s a breakthrough and not just an incremental tweak.”
```

```
If I restarted this entire project today, knowing what I know now, what would I build?
```

```
Given this situation, identify hidden or implicit constraints I might be assuming without noticing.

- First, list the explicit constraints I’ve stated.
- Then infer implicit constraints (things I seem to be assuming about tools, scope, roles, timelines, risks, or ‘how this must be done’).
- For each implicit constraint, say whether it is likely truly necessary or could be questioned or relaxed, and what would change if we did.
```

```
 How would I solve this if I only cared about physics, not politics?
```


```
 If I had to achieve this 10 times faster, what would I do?
```

```
What would this look like if it had to scale to millions?
```

```
Which part of this solution creates the most leverage?
