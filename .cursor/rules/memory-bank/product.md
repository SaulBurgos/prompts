# Product Overview

## Why this project exists

This project centralizes the best AI prompts in one Git repository so they are easy to find, reuse,
and improve over time without losing track of previous versions.

## Problems it solves

- Scattered prompts across notes, apps, or files.
- Losing track of how a “good” prompt evolved or which version worked best.
- No single place to store both the prompt text and commentary/notes.

## How it should work

- Each prompt is stored as a Markdown file (one file per prompt) under a simple folder structure.
- Git is used to add new prompts, refine them with commits, and experiment in branches when needed.
- Tags can mark especially good or “stable” prompt versions.
- Notes about each prompt live next to the prompt text inside the same file.

## User experience goals

- Very low friction to add or edit prompts.
- Easy to review the full history of any single prompt.
- Clear separation but close proximity between the prompt text and personal notes.
- Simple enough to maintain long term without extra tools beyond Git and a text editor.
