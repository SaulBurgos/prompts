# Technologies and Setup

## Core technologies

- **Git**: used to version control the entire prompt library, including history, branches, and tags.
- **Markdown**: format for both prompts and documentation files.
- **Operating system**: macOS (darwin 24.6.0).
- **Editor/IDE**: Cursor (and/or any text editor that works well with Git and Markdown).

## Development setup

- Repository is local on the filesystem and initialized as a Git repo.
- No external services or databases are required; everything is file-based.

## Technical constraints and patterns

- Keep the structure simple so prompts remain easy to browse and edit.
- Prefer readable Markdown over complex tooling.
- Use Git commands (commit, log, diff, tag, branches) as the main mechanism for tracking and exploring prompt evolution.
