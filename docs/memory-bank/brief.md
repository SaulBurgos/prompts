# Project Brief

## Overview
A personal prompts library repository for storing, versioning, and managing reusable AI prompts and agent configurations. The repository uses Git for version control, allowing safe experimentation, branching, and tagging of prompt versions. It also includes Cursor-specific configurations (AGENTS.md, commands, skills) and templates for setting up Memory Bank systems in other projects.

## Core Requirements
- Store reusable prompts as Markdown files in `prompts/` directory
- Track prompt evolution using Git (commits, branches, tags)
- Provide Cursor agent configurations and workflows
- Include Memory Bank templates for other projects
- Support both simple prompts and complex multi-file prompt templates

## Out of Scope
- Not a web application or service
- Not a database-driven system
- Not a collaborative platform (single-user repository)
