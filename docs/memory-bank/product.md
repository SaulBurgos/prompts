- Cursor commands for common operations (e.g., adding new prompts)
- Skills for repeatable workflows (Memory Bank initialization, updates, compression)
- Templates directory for reusable agent context kits

## User experience goals
- Simple file-based structure that's easy to navigate
- Clear Git workflow for version control
- Easy to copy templates and configurations to new projects
